## Summary
City Bike saw a lot of usage in August. Most of it was by men during commute hours. However, there is a significnat amount of usage by women and by people who did not state their gender.

Some Bikes saw significantly more use, and it would be good to inspect those to see if any service is needed. 

Two other visualizations that might be helpful are:
1. Duration of ride based on starting station
2. Duration of ride based on age
